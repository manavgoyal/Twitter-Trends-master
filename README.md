Trends_Project
==============
This is a CS61A class project assigned by professor John DeNero in Fall '13.

In this project, I developed a geographic visualization of Twitter data across the USA.
The map displayed depicts how the people in different states feel about something say "X". 
This image is generated by:
- Collecting public Twitter posts (tweets) that have been tagged with geographic locations and filtering for those that contain the "X" query term;
- Assigning a sentiment (positive or negative) to each tweet, based on all of the words it contains;
- Aggregating tweets by the state with the closest geographic center;
- Coloring each state according to the aggregate sentiment of its tweets. Red means positive sentiment; blue means negative.
